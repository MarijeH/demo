#9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt
#and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail
#messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the
#second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail.
#The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's
#mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in
#the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads
#through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most
#prolific committer.

#reading in the file and importing string 
import string
name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)

#making the dictionary and looping through it to clean it
counts = dict()
for line in handle:
    line = line.rstrip()
    words = line.split()
    if len(words) < 1:
        continue
    # Needs guardian pattern because empty line
    if words[0] != 'From':
        continue
    else:
        email = words[1]
        counts[email] = counts.get(email,0) +1
        #above is the condensed version of below
        #if email not in counts:
        #    counts[email] = 1
        #else:
        #    counts[email] +=1

#setting the values and finding the maximum 
largest = -1
theword = None
for k,v in counts.items() :
   if v > largest :
       largest = v
       theword = k
print(theword, largest)
